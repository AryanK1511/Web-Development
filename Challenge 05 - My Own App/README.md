# Bookworm Web Application
BookWorm is a web application that is created with the aim of developing a reading habit in people. This application helps you to search any book that you want and add it to your reading list. This feature helps you track and make an account of the books that you are reading or are planning to read in the future. You can create a reading list and can delete the books that you have added as well. You also have an option in your reading list to sort according to alphabetical order.

The app is hosted online using Heroku's cloud platform hosting service and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
