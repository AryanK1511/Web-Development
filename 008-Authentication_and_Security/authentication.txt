What is authentication and why do we authenticate?
As we create our website or web app for users to use, they start generating data. We need to create an account for each user to uniquely identify them on the database. This helps people to keep their data private.

The other reason to add auth is to restrict access to certain parts of the website depending on the status of the user.

Auth can be done in several ways. The difficult part comes from how secure you are going to make your website. There are different levels of security.
