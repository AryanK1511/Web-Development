This repository contains all the files, notes and programs that I created while taking Angela Yu's ["Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gG3@LtNx6kmn3N_Oz4x5ib4RAU9vXplzDYIww3EUM-CcbjH4D-1-HX29H7ovEfB9QgUh/) Course on Udemy. I have also used various other resources to learn web devlopment and have combined all my learnings into this repository.

This repo focuses on both frontend and backend Web Development. 

I have also added some of my code and notes to this repository along with notes that are provided by the courses that I have taken down the road. 

This repo also contains questions and challenges that have helped me to strengthen my concepts.
